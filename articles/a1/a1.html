    <h1>How to setup your mobile phone with sympy to use as an engineering calculator</h1>
    <p>In many engineering disciplines, students have to solve problems which are not 
        necessarily numeric. For example, they have to compute the determinant of a 
        matrix that has some non-numeric elements. For this reason, symbolic libraries 
        are the best tool to use and since nowadays all people have powerful mobile 
        phones, I am going to show you how you can use your mobile as an engineering 
        calculator like Casio Classpad or TI calculator.</p>
    <p>Although Classpad has an app on google play, it has limited features that 
        want you to sign up first, besides that it does not have a perfect U</p>
    <p>You can also install Julia on Termux, and you can use QuickEdit text 
        editor but those apps are not discussed here.
    </p>
    <h3>step 1:</h3>
    <p>Install Termux from 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en&gl=US">google play</a></p>
    <h3>step 2:</h3>
    <p>Install CodeBoard from 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gazlaws.codeboard&hl=en&gl=US">google play</a></p>
    <h3>step 3:</h3>
    <p>Open the CodeBoard app and edit the line which shows (Main keyboard [Second Row])</p>

    <h3>step 4:</h3>
    <p>Open Termux, and wait for the installation to complete. Then to update the packages 
        type the following command (it may ask you a confirmation to enter Y and enter to continue)
    </p>
    <p><code>$   pkg upgrade</code></p>

    <h3>step 5:</h3>
    <p>Now you need to install Python:</p>
    <p><code>$   pkg install python</code></p>
    <img src="im3.png" alt="termux3">
    <h3>step 6:</h3>
    <p>Now you should update pip package manager first:</p>
    <p><code>$   pip install â€“upgrade pip</code></p>

    <h3>step 7:</h3>
    <p>The next step is to install sympy itself (it is preferred to install ipython also):</p>
    <p><code>$   pip install sympy ipython</code></p>
    <img src="im5.png" alt="termux5">
    <h3>step 8:</h3>
    <p>now instead of importing sympy and then defining every single symbol, you can easily start isympy 
        with -a flag to automatically create missing symbols.</p>
    <p><code>$   isympy -a</code></p>
